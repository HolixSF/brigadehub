### Simplify your brigade's website maintenence

BrigadeHub is a **pre-alpha** work in progress of a Code for America Brigade website/portal. This project is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing both a regional brigade and the individual project teams within that brigade.

***BrigadeHub is not production-ready. If you deploy this to your production brigade site, you do so at your own risk.***

For a complete top-down view of the roadmap, take a look at our active ***[Roadmap Wiki](https://github.com/sfbrigade/brigadehub/wiki/Roadmap)***

In short, BrigadeHub is designed to meet some very specific goals:

- Be the external face for the brigade
- Show Leadership / Contact info / member bios
- Brigade Blogging
- Show upcoming events and calendars through Meetup and Google Calendar API integration
- Give new users a place to onboard through tight integration with Github oauth and expandable API integrations
- Display and market active projects through Github API integration
- Allow non-developers to update website info at-will
- Allow developers to hack and customize as desired
- Allow brigades to launch with a single non-dev step to their own environment (most likely Heroku)

This project is originally based on [sahat/hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) (and that's where most of the deploy documents come from), but the codebase has been heavily modified to meet our needs. We are working on conforming to the [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) javascript styling, though the original boilerplate didn't conform to that, so it's a wip.

Inspirations
------------

Similar projects have been conceived and implemented previously, most prominently by [CodeForPhilly](https://codeforphilly.org/) in the form of [Laddr](https://github.com/CfABrigadePhiladelphia/laddr), however, these implementations have limitations that make it difficult to utilize on a mass-scale. BrigadeHub overcomes these deficiencies by utilizing:

- A system that isn't based in PHP, and didn't require a custom Linux VM to run
- The cross-discipline talents of Node.js developers, who generally can move from front-back end quickly
- A one-click deployment system, preferably to Heroku, that would make deployment of a new hub effortless
- A platform tightly coupled with the Github API, for oauth, handling permissioning and adminning of the github repos easily
- A system that easily lends itself to additional onboarding steps for new members.

Other projects from which we draw inspiration include [CodeForAtlanta](http://www.codeforatlanta.org/)'s [Connector](https://github.com/codeforatlanta/connector), and [Chime](https://github.com/chimecms/chime) -- the latter of which was was a CMS that focused on local governments, rather than brigades.

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, we recommended  watching the
[Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Another great tutorial for complete beginners is: [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).

#### Install
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repo:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/sfbrigade/brigadehub.git

# Change directory
cd brigadehub

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# If needed, start mongodb in a separate tab
mongod
```

#### Usage

To run the server in production, run:

```bash
npm start
```

or if starting for local development:

```bash
npm run develop
```

### Deploy

***brigadehub is not production-ready. If you deploy this to your production brigade site, you do so at your own risk.***

If you are outside Code for San Francisco and you want to get a version of brigadehub up for your brigade, fork sfbrigade/brigadehub into your own brigade's organization. Updates should be done using upstream fetches. Contributing back should be done via Pull Request back to this repository.

These instructions will be updated as the project emerges from the Alpha-release haze.
